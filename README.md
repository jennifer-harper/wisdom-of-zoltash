// PROJECT: THE WISDOM OF ZOLTASH

//  Page description: step right up, and prepare to be dazzled by these super accurate fortune telling feats. The page will ask you a question, then populate to another
// page asking for a different question. Then a third one. Finally, you will be given the answers you've sought for so long.

// Ideas for questions:

// The final page will give you a (partially random) response from a database of three responses, but where some personlization has been made and modifications done based on user input.

// Learning competencies this will use:

// - Displaying pages using handlebars
// - capturing user input, then modifying pre-existing data to encapsulate this 

- 

// [ ] handlebars files to set up layouts
// [ ] main.css file
// [ ] index.js file
// [ ] data.json
